# Code Organization
This directory contains all files the server code writes to that the GUI reads to update each page

## Files
The purpose of each of these .txt or .png files is to contain information that is updated by `server.py` and any code it calls while it is running. This information is read by the GUI pages and displayed as needed. These files are all constantly updated through the running of this system.
