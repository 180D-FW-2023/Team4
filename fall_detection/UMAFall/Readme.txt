Sensors:

Take SensorTag's Accelerometer: MPU-9250 MEMS MotionTracking Device - Invensense as dataset source
--> Maximum Range: 16 G                                                    
--> Resolution: 0.00024 G
--> Sampling Rate: 20 Hz                                          

Device Location: WAIST                                           

Take the front 10s time of data which including fall activity.

1st column is the acceleration data in the X axis measured by the device MPU-9250.
2nd column is the acceleration data in the Y axis measured by the device MPU-9250.
3rd column is the acceleration data in the Z axis measured by the device MPU-9250.
